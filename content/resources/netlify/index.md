Netlify is a hosting platform that allows you to focus less on the configuration side of things so that you can keep doing what you like doing best -- developing! If you have ever hosted a website, you'll know that some parts of the setup can be a bit time consuming, and not necessarily something that you feel like working on. Netlify solves this problem by taking care of "all the things" for you: SSL, DNS, even CI/CD. To get an idea of just how quick and powerful Netlify can be, check out this [quick tutorial with Gatsby and Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/blog-netlify-cms-tutorial/).
