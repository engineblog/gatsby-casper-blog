If youâ€™re at all like me, you are particular about the way your code is formatted, but find the manual process of formatting it a bit tedious. This is especially true for me when I am copy-pasting code snippets from something like Stack Overflow.

Prettier is a text-editor plugin that does a beautiful (or pretty?) job of solving this problem by auto-formatting your code for you! Prettier supports just about any language and text editor that you can think of, and can be tailored to your specific preferences. For example, I find HTML far easier to read when I put blank lines between related groups of tags, so I configured Prettier to bypass auto-formatting on HTML files.

For those that are curious: I use Prettier with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
