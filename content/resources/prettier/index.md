If youâ€™re at all like me, you are particular about the way your code is formatted, but find the manual process of formatting it a bit tedious. This is especially true for me when I am copy-pasting code snippets from something like Stack Overflow.

Prettier is a text-editor plugin that does a beautiful (pretty?) job of solving this problem by auto-formatting your code for you! Prettier supports just about any programming language and text editor that you can think of, and can be tailored to your specific preferences. For example, I find HTML far easier to read when I put blank lines between related groups of tags, so I configured Prettier to bypass auto-formatting on HTML files in the [.prettierignore file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html).
