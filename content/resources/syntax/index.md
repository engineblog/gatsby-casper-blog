Syntax is one of my favorite podcasts, and such is an excellent and entertaining resource for web developers of any skill level. Focused primarily on Javascript, hosts Scott Tolinski and Wes Bos talk on a myriad of topics: Testing, security, accessibility, soft skills, React, Svelte, Vue -- pretty much anything that involves Javascript in any way. Syntax releases new episodes every Monday and Wednesday, so it's a great way to stay informed on the latest web development tools and trends.
