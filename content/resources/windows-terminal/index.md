Although it is still in a “preview” release, I think Windows Terminal is a great alternative to Command Prompt for Windows users. It allows you to have multiple tabs (much like a browser) and set custom background images and color schemes. It supports PowerShell, Command Prompt, Azure Cloud, and even Ubuntu if you’re using [WSL](#wsl). I have high hopes for Windows Terminal, and believe it will eventually replace the other Microsoft shell utilities, in favor of one consolidated application. If you want to get even more out of your terminal, check out [Wes Bos's free course](#command-line-power-user)
