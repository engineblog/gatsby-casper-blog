This one is a bit more region-specific, as Revature is a boot camp that requires you to attend in-person. At the time of this writing, Revature has training locations in Virginia, West Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas. Revature aims to solve the “catch 22” scenario we are all too familiar with: The entry-level jobs you are applying for require experience, but you need to first work an entry-level job to get that experience. Revature _does_ require a Bachelor’s degree, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be in Computer Science or IT.

The way it works is: You get hired by Revature and spend 2-3 months in the boot camp, learning a specific technology. You also learn some important soft skills, including how to interview better. As the boot camp nears its end, Revature will set you up with a series of interviews with their partnered clients so that you can go straight into a software development role once your time at Revature is up. The catch is that **you must be willing to relocate anywhere in the United States** for your post-Revature position, and you are **contracted into that position for two years**.

I got started with Salesforce via Revature, attaining two certifications in the process. Unfortunately, you do not have a say in which technology you are assigned, and you won’t find out which one you will be learning until your first day “on the job”. I say “on the job” because unlike a lot of boot camps, Revature actually hires you, and pays you \$8/hour while attending the boot camp.

Some other technology curriculums offered by Revature include: Full stack Java, .NET, ServiceNow, AWS, Pega, and Hadoop.
