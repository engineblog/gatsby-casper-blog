A spell checker? Really? I know, I know –- but this is actually really important! If you think about it, software development is centered around the idea of creating and using tools that do the work for you, and save you time. This Visual Studio Code extension does just that. Plus, if you’re writing code in any sort of professional capacity, spelling mistakes don’t exactly reflect well on you. I didn’t really realize that I needed this tool until I started writing [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files for this blog. A big reason for using markdown files is so that you can just write your content in plain English, and not have to worry about throwing in things like anchor (`<a>`) tags. It’s almost like you’re writing your content in Microsoft Word. So if you’re going to write your content that way, you might as well get some the benefits of using something like Word, but in your code editor.
