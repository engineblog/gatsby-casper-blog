DigitalOcean is a developer-focused service that allows you to host and scale your web application."Developer-focused" meaning that you get virtual access to your server, as opposed to more generic hosting solutions that give you drag-and-drop interfaces. This means that you get to install the OS of your choice, and configure it with as much storage and computing power as you need. DigitalOcean also offers "1-Click Applications" through their [marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com), so you can quickly get started with things like Docker, a LAMP stack, Wordpress, and tons of other platforms.
