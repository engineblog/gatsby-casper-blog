Docker is a powerful DevOps tool that allows you to maintain, structure, and deploy your applications in a containerized way. You can configure Docker to keep parts of your application separated into these "containers" -- back end, front end, microservices, etc.. Docker is conceptually similar to using Virtual Machines, but it manages resources much differently (and often more efficiently) at a hardware level. Using Docker is also a good way to manage your application's dependencies. Docker can be a bit tough to get into, but Nick Janetakis does a great job of making the concepts easy to understand in this course.
