If you've ever tried learning Docker, but found the barrier-to-entry a bit too high, then you should check out this course by Nick Janetakis. He does a great job of making the concepts easy to understand, with actual examples to solidify those concepts. In the course, you'll learn what Docker is, why you might want to use it, and use those ideas to make some simple applications to showcase Docker's benefits. More specifically, you learn how to use Dockerfiles, volumes, containers, and images, as well as how to set up Docker for your specific operating system.
