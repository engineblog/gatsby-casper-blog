Trello is a free organizational / project management tool that lets you manages your tasks in a [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) style. Trello is highly-customizable, by way of their [Power Ups](https://trello.com/power-ups). Offering pre-built solutions (like Github integration) as well as the ability to "roll your own" by creating custom Power Ups, you can mold Trello to your unique Workflow. If you're interested in building your own Power Up, the [official Trello tutorial](https://tech.trello.com/power-up-tutorial-part-one/) is a great place to start.
