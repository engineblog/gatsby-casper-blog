This is a free course from Wes Bos, designed to help you attain a better terminal setup. He goes over different terminal options for Mac and Windows users, as well as several terminal plug-ins that will make your life easier as a developer. I personally use Windows Terminal with WSL, zsh and oh-my-zsh.
