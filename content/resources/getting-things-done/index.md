If you're familiar with GTD, you'll notice that I didn't link to an official GTD resource; that's because "Getting Things Done" is not a standalone product. Getting Things Done is a book, a mindset, a brand -- some might even say "mantra". Read: GTD is a system created by David Allen, designed to help you prioritize, categorize, and (most importantly) carry out all of the things you need to do. The primary principle of GTD is to close off all of your mind's "open loops". Open loops are things that you know you need to do, but aren't able to do at the present time. If these loops are not closed, they will remain in your mind, causing unnecessary fatigue. You close these open loops by writing the things down, into a system that you know you will regularly check and maintain. The audio book was not for me, but I was able to get enough of an idea from the link in this header. Getting Things Done is also an excellent use case for using [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/), because I personally do not think that reading (or listening to) the entire book is necessary.
