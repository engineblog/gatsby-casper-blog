This podcast is less on the technical side, and more on the career side of things. In each episode, Joel Hooks and John Lindquist talk to a different software developer. These developer chats can range in topics from blogging, learning, debugging, software architecture, work/life balance, mentorship, open source culture, and everything in between.
