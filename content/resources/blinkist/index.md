Blinkist solves a true problem -- wanting to read books without wanting to spend the time. Blinkist condenses books into ten or so "blinks", or short summaries of the main points of the book. These "blinks" can be consumed in 15 - 20 minutes. Another nice thing about Blinkist is that it gives you the option to either listen to the summaries, read them, or switch between the two. Nice!
