Blinkist solves a true problem -- wanting to read books without wanting to spend the time. Blinkist condenses books into ten or so "blinks" (short summaries) of the main points of the book. These blinks enable you to consume the core concepts of a book in 15 - 20 minutes. You won't find many (if any) novels on Blinkist, but there are tons of titles that fall in the realm of "how-to". Another nice thing about Blinkist is that it gives you the option to either listen to the summaries, read them, or switch between the two. Nice!
