This is a platform that allows you to learn basically any frontend technology through video tutorials. Frontend Masters is similar to Level Up Tutorials, but with a couple of key differences. On Level Up Tutorials, most courses are taught by one instructor; Frontend Masters brings in many industry professionals to teach their courses. Frontend Masters also allows you to preview the first part of any course before deciding to buy in. However, Frontend Masters does not offer an "a la carte" option, and you must pay the monthly fee to get access to any and all courses. I personally do not have a subscription to Frontend Masters, but find it useful to get a quick peek into a given topic. They also offer a mobile app so you can watch videos on the go.
