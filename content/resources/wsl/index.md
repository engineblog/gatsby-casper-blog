Otherwise known as WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux is a very welcomed feature for developers that use Windows as their primary operating system. In my experience, command line installations have always been much easier when using a Unix-based operating system, in comparison to Windows. WSL does a pretty dang good job of solving that issue by giving you the power to use Linux from within your Windows environment. No more dual booting!
