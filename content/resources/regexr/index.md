Before I started this blog, I felt overwhelmed trying to research what framework I should use, if any. Watching his [Web Development in 2020 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw){:target="\_blank"} helped answer a lot of my questions, and definitely gave me a better idea of what my options where, given the direction I wanted to take. His channel also has "crash courses" that give you a quick run-down of a topic in about an hour or two. His [NPM Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0) helped me get a core foundation of npm, and allowed me to get past a lot of frustrating npm installs.
