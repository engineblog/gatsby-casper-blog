I came from a background in back-end development, so I needed to get my front-end skills up to snuff. In this course, Wes Bos explains everything from debugging tools to loops, promises, and async await -- all with great examples that are easy to follow. Truthfully, I have not finished the course yet, but I would not have been able to get this blog up without completing the parts that I have so far.
