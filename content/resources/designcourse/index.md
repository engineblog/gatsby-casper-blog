I have not watched many DesignCourse videos, but I can tell that it is quality content, with solid information. As you might guess from the name, the focus is more on the design aspect of frontend development. When I first set up my Digital Ocean droplet, I browsed through the one-click installs and realized I didn't know what a lot of the software was. I was interested in Ghost, and ended up on this [two-part series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE1rGl1HKr4), which really gave me some insight on how to leverage modern frontend technology.
