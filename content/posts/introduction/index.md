I know, the introduction usually comes first. But I tend to do things 'out of order', so it was only fitting that the sequence of my blog posts followed suit.

This is going to be a longer post. It will flow in chronological order throughout different stages of my life. It might start off seeming like "my life's story" -- it's not. Think of this post more as, "My Tech Journey, With Some Real Life Thrown In".

In other words, these things I am sharing with you all played a significant part in the inception of _The Engine_ because they all relate back to learning, mindset and (in some way) technology.

## An early (false) start

I've always been interested in tinkering with things, even as a kid. I remember taking apart old remote controls and other electronics to try and figure out how they worked. I was always so excited before I took them apart, thinking I would use the the parts to make my own electronics. That never happened, though. I would get the device down to the circuit boards and wires, and then feel disappointed and overwhelmed that I didn't know what to do with any of the parts.

I've I always been a 'tinkerer', but I seem to have trouble bridging the gap to become a _maker_.

As I got a little older, I attended a couple of technology summer camps. I learned things like basic auto tech, soldering circuit boards, and HTML. I remember trying to clone the Diablo II character bios from the official webpage, but lost interest after I realized that I had no idea how to structure the layout.

Are you seeing the pattern?

In high school, I had a fair amount of exposure to technology. I was lucky enough to take courses on Java, Visual Basic, Flash, graphic design, even telecommunications. I did fairly well in the courses I took during my junior year. But in my senior year, things changed quite a bit. It was like taking apart the remote control all over again -- except this time, not putting it back together had real consequences.

## Rejected

I don't know if 'senioritis' has enough magnitude to accurately describe my last year of high school. It was bad, man. Really bad. Needless to say, my priorities were all kinds of misplaced, and my grades plummeted. They took _such_ a nose dive, in fact, that the one school I applied to (and got into) actually **retracted their offer** after receiving my final high school transcript.

Instead of having a "come to Jesus" moment, I wallowed aimlessly through community college, my behavior much unchanged, my major undeclared. Little did I know, my epiphany was fast approaching.

## A frank conversation

It was the first Thanksgiving since I had graduated from high school. Sitting around the table with my mom, dad and brother, the conversation naturally drifted towards school. Apparently, my parents had received a letter from the community college, stating that I was on academic probation.

You know how disappointing someone often feels worse than making them angry? Yeah, this was exactly that situation.

"What happened to you?", my dad asked.

"You know, you don't _have_ to go to school", my mom offered.

I felt awful. Of course I wanted to go to school. I just had no idea what I wanted to go to school _for_.

## A break in the clouds

I went home that night, and refused to go to bed until I figured out "what I want to be when I grow up". I had always heard that you should try and pick something that you enjoy, so I decided to start there. I sat and thought about the things that I did in my spare time.

I was always on the computer.

Granted, I wasn't really doing anything productive on the computer. I would chat with friends on AIM, download music, and play Counterstrike. There wasn't really much I could do career-wise with any of that.

But then, I thought about it some more. I always needed my friend's help installing software like mIRC or Winamp plugins. It was kind of embarrassing, really. Then it came to me:

If I was going to spend most of my time on the computer, I might as well gain a better understanding of it. I was always curious about how computers really worked, but always just wrote the idea off because it seemed too hard. That remote control was still laughing in my face, all these years later.

But I realized that it didn't have to be that way. I realized that I was capable. I was interested, motivated, and had something to prove.

The next day, I registered for my first semester as an IT major.

## Reasons Reap Results

Got accepted into mason after being rejected

Was working at a front desk that allowed me to work on schoolwork on the job

Had a son, moved away from that job, got a job at a dental clinic because I was commuting a long way to the front desk job after having my son.

Hated the dental clinic job, heard about an opportunity doing tech support, but required A+ certification. Started studying for the certification during my lunch breaks as well as any free time I had.

This was right around the time I was taking an **online** PHP class in college. The fact that it was online messed me up, but it did present some interesting learning opportunities. I remember struggling with what a "hidden form field" was, even after asking the teacher for an explanation, watching a bunch of YouTube videos, and looking at examples online.

Then, one day working at my call center job, the manager sent out a message asking the team who knew how to code. He asked me to show him an example of what I could do. I remember going for a walk and thinking about how cool of an opportunity this was, and I remember the exact place I was in my walk when I realized what I was going to do: Make a ticketing system using the PHP that I was learning in school.

When constructing the login page, I needed a way to display a unique profile for each user that logged in. I needed to pass the user's ID to the next page without having the user enter their username again. And then it hit me -- _this_ is where I need to use a hidden form field. It all made sense. Theory and knowledge are great, but without having applied that knowledge, it's just information bouncing around your brain, no different than knowing what year the Magna Carta was signed.

Rapid Development Scalable Applications

Telescope

Capstone project - It was at this point that I actually realized what 'web development' was. Before this, I always thought it was purely HTML and CSS. I thought I had to have an eye for design, and I was always terrible in art class. If only I had known, I would have chose 'web development' was my concentration

Startups put a bad taste in my mouth

## Bootcamp

Solidified knowledge, learned an in-demand skill

## On the job

Not what I expected, didn't get to code.

Was not enjoying work, decided to do something I enjoyed on the side

## Thought I was going to be a YouTuber

DigitalOcean, set everything up, branded as 'Intermediate Developer', 'Programming is Hard' -- then realized that I wanted to have more of a positive message.

Have so many ideas and kept loading up on courses, and realized that I wasn't actually doing any work. Just kept learning and piling things on.

Blog seemed like a good way to actually get my hands dirty, and also serve as a resource for myself and others

## Why is it called 'The Engine'?

- I like cars
- Little Engine that Could
- My brother liked trains as a kid, and he wants to learn HTML/CSS
