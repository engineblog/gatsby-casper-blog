I know, the introduction usually comes first. But I tend to do things 'out of order', so it was only fitting that the sequence of my blog posts followed suit.

This is going to be a longer post. It will flow in chronological order throughout different stages of my life. It might start off seeming like "my life's story" -- it's not. Think of this post more as, "My Tech Journey, With Some Real Life Thrown In".

In other words, these things I am sharing with you all played a significant part in the inception of _The Engine_ because they all relate back to learning, mindset and (in some way) technology.

## An early (false) start

I've always been interested in tinkering with things, even as a kid. I remember taking apart old remote controls and other electronics to try and figure out how they worked. I was always so excited before I took them apart, thinking I would use the parts to make my own electronics. That never happened, though. I would get the device down to the circuit boards and wires, and then feel disappointed and overwhelmed that I didn't know what to do with any of the parts.

Tinkering came naturally, but I seemed to have trouble bridging the gap to become a _maker_.

As I got a little older, I attended a couple of technology summer camps. I learned things like basic auto tech, soldering circuit boards, woodworking, and HTML. I remember trying to clone the Diablo II character bios from the official webpage, but lost interest after I realized that I had no idea how to structure the layout.

Are you starting to see a pattern?

In high school, I had a fair amount of exposure to technology. I was lucky enough to take courses on Java, Visual Basic, Flash, graphic design, even telecommunications. I did fairly well in the courses I took during my junior year. But in my senior year, things changed quite a bit. It was like taking apart the remote control all over again -- except this time, not putting it back together had real consequences.

## Rejected

I don't know if 'senioritis' has enough gravity to accurately describe my last year of high school. It was bad, man. **Real** bad. Needless to say, my priorities were all kinds of misplaced, and my grades plummeted. They took _such_ a nose dive, in fact, that the _one school_ I applied to (and got into) actually **retracted their offer** after receiving my final high school transcript.

Instead of having a "come to Jesus" moment, I wallowed aimlessly through community college, my behavior much unchanged, my major undeclared. Little did I know, my epiphany was fast approaching.

## A frank conversation

It was the first Thanksgiving since I had graduated from high school. Sitting around the table with my mom, dad and brother, the conversation naturally drifted towards school. Apparently, my parents had received a letter from the community college, stating that I was on academic probation.

You know how sometimes, disappointing someone feels worse than making them angry? Yeah, this was exactly that situation.

"What happened to you?", my dad asked.

"You know, you don't _have_ to go to school", my mom offered.

I felt awful. Of course I wanted to go to school. I just had no idea what I wanted to go to school _for_.

## A break in the clouds

I went home that night, and refused to go to bed until I figured out what I wanted "to be when I grow up". I had always heard that you should try and pick something that you enjoy, so I decided to start there. I sat and thought about the things that I did in my spare time.

I was always on the computer.

Granted, I wasn't really doing anything productive on the computer. I would chat with friends on AIM, download music, and play Counterstrike. There wasn't really much I could do career-wise with any of that.

But then, I thought about it some more. I always needed my friend's help installing software like mIRC or Winamp plugins. It was kind of embarrassing, really. I wished I could understand the software better. Then it came to me:

I enjoyed the coding I did in my Java class in my highschool, even though I didn't fully understand the scope of what I was doing. If I could go to school and learn how to actually _build_ software, then surely I would have a better understanding of software in general. I had always been curious about how software worked under the hood, but always just wrote the idea off because it seemed too hard. That remote control was still laughing in my face, all these years later.

But I realized that it didn't have to be that way. I realized that I was capable. I was interested, motivated, and had something to prove.

The next day, I registered for my first semester as an Computer Science major.

## Progress is Progress

At this point, you might be thinking that I declared my major as Computer Science, and everything magically fell into place.

Not quite.

My outlook on school definitely changed after declaring my major. I stopped skipping class, and I took my courses seriously. It really is amazing how even the smallest sense of purpose can push you forward.

The issue was that the 100-level Java course was kicking my _ass_. I was throwing everything I had at the course, but I couldn't help but feel like there were a lot of fundamentals I was missing. There was a brief review of the fundamentals at the beginning of the course, but it quickly evolved into being expected to write applications. I wasn't ready for that yet.

So I was in a bit of a quandary: I was actually interested in what I was learning, but felt it was going at too quick of a pace for me. I could have tried to struggle through it, but I knew myself well enough to know that doesn't work for me. I have to feel good about what I'm doing; simply being interested in it isn't enough.

I decided to meet with a career advisor at the community college.

## Take Two

Let me first start off by saying that I believe meeting with a career advisor at your college is extremely valuable and incredibly underrated.

When I met with my advisor, I explained how I felt about the Java Course. I was expecting them to suggest that I switch back to general education classes until I "found my way". Instead, they immediately offered up a suggestion that I didn't even realize was an option, almost as if other students had come to them with similar reservations.

What my advisor suggested was the 'Applied Information Technology' transfer program. Now, I say 'program' instead of 'major' because this was a specific path that essentially guaranteed entry to the local university, provided a certain GPA was maintained. Students in the transfer program take their base-level IT classes at the community college, which are directly transferrable to the local university. Once at the local University, the "real" AIT curriculum would begin. I must have seemed interested, and the advisor went more in depth on the AIT structure at the University.

Instead of being purely focused on coding, the AIT program offered several different paths to take within the world of IT -- web development, information security, database / programming, and telecom. The idea was that a student could take up any of these "concentrations", without any prior knowledge, and learn not only the technical side of things, but also the practical business applications.

I was sold. I promptly enrolled in the transfer program, intrigued by the concentration in 'Database Technology and Programming'.

## Back to Basics

My first coding-related course in my new major was 'Introduction to Computer Programming'. What made this class stand out was the fact that coding on the computer was not part of the course curriculum -- at all.

I got the sense that other students were kind of disappointed at that fact, but it was exactly what I needed. We learned how software interacts with the machine at the most basic level: Input, Processing, and Output. We did not write code; we wrote pseudocode. I loved every minute of it, and did very well in the class.

Sure enough, after taking the introductory course, I felt like I had gotten into a groove, and was able to secure an A in the 100-level Java course.

I had finally found something that checked all the boxes for me: It was interesting, challenging, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.

After a couple of semesters in my new groove, another letter came from the community college. This time, it was to inform me that I had made Dean's List. The funny thing is, I wasn't even thinking about trying to make good grades; I was simply enjoying what I was learning, and trying to put my best foot forward.

## Redeemed

My studies continued going well, and I completed the transfer credits at the community college. I began attending the local university. What I have intentionally left out until this point is that the local University actually is **the college I applied to in high school**. You know, the one that retracted their offer.

It felt somewhat triumphant, getting re-accepted to the school that had originally dropped me. There was no time to rest on my pseudo-laurels, though. The courses were becoming more challenging, and I had a Bachelor's degree to procure!

## Pivot

Life is funny sometimes. Or, as someone more profound than I once said:

> Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.

This applied to me quite literally. In the midst of planning out my tech trajectory, I became a father. Things changed _fast_. When my son was born, I moved further away from the University, and opted for online courses when they were available so that I could spend more time at home.

The online courses posed a bit of a challenge. General courses like English and Project Management were no problem, but the more technical courses that were specific to my major were a different story.

## Sink or Swim

I like to ask a lot of questions when I'm learning something technical. I was the student that had their hand up at least once per class. Hey, school is expensive; you might as well get your money's worth.

Anyway, my point is: That approach didn't really work as well for me in an online setting. The professors aren't going for the whiteboard to explain things in detail. It's not nearly as engaging, especially for a visual learner.

#### Enter: The Online PHP Course

This is the class I probably struggled the most with at the University, but it wasn't because PHP was difficult for me. This class covered PHP, HTML, and CSS. PHP came pretty easily because of the Java classes I had taken. HTML has never been an issue for me. It was the CSS that threw me out of my element.

CSS has always been my weak point. Truthfully, it still is. I have no issue applying font faces and colors; the layouts are where I seem to fall down, hence the Gatsby theme.

There was an assignment for this course that included a list of CSS requirements. I distinctly remember going down the list, making changes to my stylesheet, and slowly checking off the requirements. Then I came to the last requirement, which was something like, "User must be able to navigate your page at various window sizes".

Oh. Right. Responsive design and all that.

Sure enough, I resized my window and the layout broke. It was incredibly frustrating, feeling like I had just done all of that work for nothing. Looking back on it, though -- it wasn't for nothing. I think about that moment every time I need to work with a CSS layout, and am therefore hyper-conscious of the 'gotchas' of responsive design.

I eventually got the responsive layout for class working, but I didn't feel good about it. I ended up doing this hacky "guess and check" method of trying random pixel values for margins and borders and padding until the layout looked aligned. I knew that I was just eyeballing it, and that there was a better, more exact way of approaching it.

I managed to get through all of the assignments for the course, but there was still the final assessment. The format of this final wasn't like anything I had done yet in college. All of my finals until this point had been things like answering terminology questions and/or analyzing small blocks of code to spot the issue. This final was a timed coding challenge.

There wasn't anything particularly challenging about the problem we were given, aside from the fact that it was timed. I tend to code slower than most, so I was a bit nervous.

The first part of the problem involved creating a login page. Simple enough. Build a basic form with HTML, store the user credentials in a text file, and use PHP to validate the credentials. I really enjoyed building my solution. That is, until I tested the login. It failed. Okay, no problem. Maybe I typed it wrong. I copy and paste the username and password from the text file. It fails again. I put echo statements in my code to verify the information is getting passed through. Everything checks out, but the login is still failing.

Almost an hour went by, and the login still wasn't working. Not to mention, there was still an entire second half of the problem to solve after the login. I started to panic. The stress and anxiety had put a lump in my throat. I was close to tears. This was the part of the course that I was supposed to be good at, and I was failing miserably. I started thinking back to the study guide that we were given in preparation for the final, trying to remember if there was a topic I had forgotten to study.

Suddenly, I knew what the issue was: The line endings. We had _very_ briefly touched on the fact that PHP adds invisible characters to the ends of lines stored in a file. In my text file, I was storing my password field at the end of the line. Now it made sense. I re-arranged the fields in the text file, and the login worked fine.

By this point, I only had about 20 minutes left to complete the assessment, and the second half was mostly CSS. I rushed through what I could, and ended up turning in an incomplete project.

It's interesting: At the time, I felt extremely disappointed in myself. Looking back on it, sure I remember the disappointment, but something else stands out more: I was able to scrape together what I had and solve a problem that initially made no sense to me. If I had skipped that part of the problem and came back to it, I may have received a better grade on the final, but I feel that I would have missed out on a valuable learning experience.

## Finish out Strong

The PHP class seemed almost like a rite of passage, and every course I took afterwards was pretty awesome.

I took an iOS development class where I learned how to use Swift and Xcode, and REST APIs. Then there was my "Rapid Development of Scalable Applications" course, where I was involved a lot of small group projects using Agile.

The real "game changer" was the senior capstone project. The idea was to form a group of AIT students of varying concentrations, and architect an IT solution for a real business. My group worked with an online consignment store that needed help automating some of their processes.

The consignment shop was using an outdated inventory management system, and the business owner wanted to replace it with something that would automate their processes. The catch was that the new system had to work with Shopify, since that is where the consignment store lived. The new system also needed to talk to FedEx and eBay. During one of our first meetings with the business owner, we were sitting around a conference table, discussing candidates for the replacement system. The issue was that every option either didn't offer enough features, offered _too many_ features, or did not support Shopify integration.

As my team members were bouncing ideas around, I started Googling. Instead of looking for inventory management systems, I was looking to see what APIs were available. Sure enough, Shopify, eBay, and FedEx all had APIs. Once there was a lull in the conversation, I suggested that we build our own solution.

The business owner liked the idea. My teammates liked the idea, but also reminded me that I was the only developer in the group. Everyone else was in Information Security. They said they were on board, but wanted to make sure that I knew I would be doing most of the work.

I didn't care. I was excited at the opportunity to take on a cumulative challenge. I didn't know the specifics on how the system would work, but I knew that it _could_ work, given the tools I had available. Sometimes, that's all you need.

## Putting it all Together

I have never learned so much from a single project as I did with that capstone project:

- I needed to "git" a lot more comfortable with version control and the command line in general.

- I learned Python because it interfaced with the Shopify API.

- I learned Django because the store needed an administrative interface.

- I learned to use pip and lock files to install and manage packages.

- I learned how to use environment variables to secure API keys.

- I learned to use Heroku to host the application.

On a less technical note, I also learned an important lesson on the career / business side of things. Once I had graduated, and the capstone project had finished, the business owner approached me. She wanted to pay me to continue developing the application, and eventually turn the service into a business. I was pumped. I had never been paid to code before.

Things were going great. There was talk of investors, and bringing in other developers to work under me as the lead developer. What I didn't realize was that when another developer was hired, I would stop getting paid so that the new developer could get paid.

After the checks stopped coming, I continued to work on the project. After all, I had laid all of the groundwork, and wanted to see this thing through. The business owner assured me that the money would start rolling in once we had the support of an investor.

That may have been true, but the whole thing just sort of put a bad taste in my mouth. When the business owner pulled the plug on paying me, I realized that I was essentially at their mercy, and felt a bit like I was being undervalued and taken advantage of. After some back and forth, I eventually pulled away. Maybe I missed out on being a millionaire. Maybe I avoided working tons of hours for free. Who knows?

Maybe I would have stuck with the startup idea if it hadn't been for my next opportunity.

## The Camp of Boots

Around the time things began fizzling out with the startup, a recruiter reached out to me. They weren't recruiting for a specific position, though; they were recruiting for a bootcamp.

## On the job

Not what I expected, didn't get to code.

Was not enjoying work, decided to do something I enjoyed on the side

## Thought I was going to be a YouTuber

DigitalOcean, set everything up, branded as 'Intermediate Developer', 'Programming is Hard' -- then realized that I wanted to have more of a positive message.

Have so many ideas and kept loading up on courses, and realized that I wasn't actually doing any work. Just kept learning and piling things on.

Blog seemed like a good way to actually get my hands dirty, and also serve as a resource for myself and others

## Why is it called 'The Engine'?

- I like cars
- Little Engine that Could
- My brother liked trains as a kid, and he wants to learn HTML/CSS
